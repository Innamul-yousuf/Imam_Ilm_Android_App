Here is a verse that reminds us of His unwavering support: \n\n**\"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient, *Who, when disaster strikes them, say, \"Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return.\"*  - [Quran 2:155-156]**\n\nThis verse beautifully captures the essence of Islamic faith. It reminds us that trials and tribulations are part of life's journey, but they should not shake our faith.  Instead, they are opportunities to strengthen our connection with Allah and demonstrate our resilience. \n\nRemember, every challenge presents a chance for growth and learning. Do not let failure define you, but rather see it as a stepping stone towards something better. Allah (SWT) is always there to guide you and support you through every hardship. \n"},
